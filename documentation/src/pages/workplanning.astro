    We organise our sprints, track issues, and review changes in Jira. The workflow below
    shows the typical paths an item can take from idea to production, including review
    loops and a dedicated hotfix lane for urgent production problems.

  <h2>Benefits of Jira workflow</h2>

  <h3>Quality Assurance benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Built-in review process: every work item goes through mandatory review before completion.</li>
    <li>Multiple review outcomes: supports rejection, minor fixes, and full approval paths.</li>
    <li>Rework loops: clear process for handling rejected or incomplete work.</li>
    <li>Production issue handling: dedicated hotfix process for urgent production problems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Project Management benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear issue lifecycle: every team member knows exactly where issues stand.</li>
    <li>Sprint planning integration: seamless flow from backlog to sprint to development.</li>
    <li>Epic management: large features are broken down into manageable stories.</li>
    <li>Blocked issue tracking: dedicated state and resolution process for impediments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Development Team benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear ownership: developer assignment is explicit in the workflow.</li>
    <li>Status transparency: everyone can see what is in progress, blocked, or under review.</li>
    <li>Flexible development: allows for extended work periods and iterative improvements.</li>
    <li>Quick fix support: separate path for minor changes that do not need the full development cycle.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Stakeholder benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Visibility: complete transparency into work progress and bottlenecks.</li>
    <li>Predictability: standardised process makes delivery timelines more reliable.</li>
    <li>Issue traceability: full audit trail from creation to closure.</li>
    <li>Feature request management: clear path for new requirements to enter the system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Process Efficiency benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced context switching: clear handoffs between development and review.</li>
    <li>Bottleneck identification: easy to spot where work is getting stuck.</li>
    <li>Automated workflows: can be enhanced with automation rules and triggers.</li>
    <li>Consistent delivery: standardised process ensures consistent quality output.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Risk Management benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Change control: all modifications go through proper review channels.</li>
    <li>Rollback capability: issues can be reopened if problems are discovered.</li>
    <li>Documentation trail: complete history of all decisions and changes.</li>
    <li>Quality gates: multiple checkpoints prevent defective work from reaching production.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Team Collaboration benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cross-functional coordination: clear handoffs between different team roles.</li>
    <li>Communication framework: status changes trigger appropriate notifications.</li>
    <li>Knowledge sharing: review process ensures multiple people understand each change.</li>
    <li>Accountability: clear ownership and responsibility at each stage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scalability benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Handles multiple issue types: stories, bugs, tasks, and epics all flow through appropriate paths.</li>
    <li>Sprint integration: works seamlessly with agile sprint planning and execution.</li>
    <li>Team growth: process remains consistent as team size increases.</li>
    <li>Process improvement: workflow can be refined based on team feedback and metrics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use it day to day</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Create or refine issues in the backlog. Link them to epics where relevant.</li>
    <li>Pick work during sprint planning and assign an owner.</li>
    <li>Move to In progress, keep comments and checklists up to date.</li>
    <li>Open a review when development is done. Reviewers request changes or approve.</li>
    <li>Merge and deploy. If a production issue appears, use the hotfix lane.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Sprint 1 Documentation (13-18 August)</h1>
  <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
    Sprint Goal: establish the project foundation by setting up the backend, frontend, and database connections,
    and completing initial design and planning documentation.

  <h2>Sprint overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 13 August - 18 August (1 week)</li>
    <li><strong>Team members:</strong> Luvo Zulu (LZ), Stephan Botha (SB), Kgadi Selepe (KS),Mokobane Rorisang(MR),Mzu Mboxo (MM)</li>
    <li><strong>Meeting date:</strong> Wednesday, 13 August</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Main discussion points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How to represent and store data retrieved from the API-Football service.</li>
    <li>Structuring the database schema for scalability.</li>
    <li>Initial design of frontend pages (Landing, Profile, System Frontend).</li>
    <li>Documentation standards and responsibility assignment.</li>
    <li>Agreement to use Jira for task tracking and progress transparency.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sprint planning</h2>
  <p>
    During sprint planning we broke the initial work into 9 backlog items, balancing technical setup,
    documentation, and design. Each item was assigned to a specific team member for ownership and
    accountability. Jira was used to formalize the distribution and provide visibility into status
    and progress.
  </p>

  </div>


  <h2>Retrospective</h2>
  <h3>What went well</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Jira kept ownership and progress visible for everyone.</li>
    <li>Early documentation enabled consistent decisions across the team.</li>
    <li>Reviews caught issues early and spread knowledge.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What could improve</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Time estimates for infra tasks were optimistic; some items carried risk and unknowns.</li>
    <li>Integration tasks were blocked waiting for deployment readiness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Actions for Sprint 2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete backend deployment early in the sprint, then connect React to API.</li>
    <li>Improve estimates where external services are involved.</li>
    <li>Keep using peer review and update docs with any architectural decisions.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Sprint 1 successfully laid the foundation of the SmartBet project. The team collaborated well using Jira to 
    assign and track work, ensuring accountability and visibility. Documentation, database schema, and early UI 
    designs are complete, while backend deployment and integration tasks will roll into Sprint 2. The sprint 
    demonstrated that our Scrum process supports clear ownership, review-based quality assurance, and continuous 
    progress toward project goals.
